In order to run this program, you must first have all the files from the ".zip" file in the same directory. Enter "make" into the command line ande the makefile will create the executables: "mandelCalc", "mandelDisplay", and "a.out". These executables will all be needed to run this program. To actually run this program, enter "./a.out filename.txt". If you enter just "./a.out", an error message will occur. You must provide a ".txt" file so the program can save the mandelbrot after running. You will be prompted to enter the values for xMin, xMax, yMin, yMax, nCols, nRows, and maxIters. After this, the mandelbrot will be displayed on screen and saved in the “.txt” file. After this, you will be prompted a question to see if you are done with the program. Enter “yes” for done or “no” for not done. If “yes”, the program terminates and reports how many images were created and displayed. If “no”, then the whole process(entering xMin, xMax, etc) of creating a process will start again.

NOTE: I was only able to print the exit codes for how many images were created and displayed in the signal handler to catch SIGCHLD in mandelbrot.c. The exit codes couldn't be received in the "If user is done" clause for some reason. 

NOTE: I am using my second late day for this assignment, so I expect no point deductions.
